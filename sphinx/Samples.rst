Samples
=================================

A collection of tests and samples to demonstrate the ``overlays`` module.


``TestAdvancedOverlays``
---------------------------------

Tutorial explaining some will go here...


``overlaytool``
---------------------------------

The ``overlaytool`` is a simple visualizer for texture slicing with
overlays, and it's also a demonstration of the power and flexibility 
of this module. All of it -- including the pointer, help window, the text,
and the resizable image itself -- was created using overlays. Working with
pixels made what would have been a difficult project a *very* simple one. 

Run it like the command line like so::

    overlaytool.py TEXTURE

Where TEXTURE is the texture to load, such as ``res/img.png``.

.. note::
    This tool was rushed and hackish, and currently only supports Windows
    (using Arial font and win32clipboard). At a later time, a cleaner,
    cross-platform tool will be released.
